# GBBPNode-LinuxAndWindows
Additional Files for a GBA GBBP Node on Linux machines including Raspberry Pi and Windows WSL2

Windows machines can easily run Ubuntu at the same time as Windows by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) per Microsoftâ€™s instructions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).


#### To install Besu, follw the instructions at https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Install-Binaries/ ####


#### To complete and run your GBBP Node ####
1. Save the current Besu config files and then replace them with the GBBP config.toml & ibft2Genesis.json files.  You will also want to create a bob (or whatever name you choose) data directory and add the file static-nodes.json to it.
2. Run your node with the command line
```
bin/besu --data-path=bob --config-file=config.toml --genesis-file=ibft2Genesis.json --min-gas-price=0 --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase=0xC3D693fBE006154eF80C288DB527FaC4bd38ca09 --logging=debug
```

At first, you will see your node connect to the GBBP but then receive a request to disconnect because it is unknown
```
Received Wire DISCONNECT (UNKNOWN) from peer: PeerInfo{version=5, clientId='besu/v20.10.0/linux-x86_64/oracle_openjdk-java-11', capabilities=[eth/62, eth/63, eth/64, IBF/1], port=30303, nodeId=0x45f5f4a243fe851b025d622140f92d645bc04a0eb67589c4d6a21a5f9f367e600637d83546c3cbf9ccfa2fae072a1fa08e236d222b3262a685c15225540df2ee}.
```
Your node will connect properly once your node has been added to the GBBP permissioning system.  Send Mark Waser the enode, public address and ip address which are shown when you are attempting to connect to the GBBP so that he can do so.
